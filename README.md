# My Personal Blog

I thought to start writing in the post-monsoon period, mostly because I felt we understand and learn quite better and faster when we
document our progress and also plan to teach other fellow students. I am writing this as my first (probably) README on GitHub, and mostly
because I am learning the MarkDown syntax now. It's pretty awesome, I can say.

## What did I use to built this?

It's really been an inspiration for me to know what stuff is built using what so that, we can improvise ourselves and learn new stacks. So, personally I am learning the **MERN** Stack now. Haven't scratched much of _React_ yet, but I believe I can master that soon.

Again, coming to the answer. I used especially **Node with Express** as the backend, powered by **MongoDB**, which I love using for it's flexibility. And coming to the npm packages, I have used **BodyParser, Ejs, Lodash**  to make the most come out of a blog page. Provided, I was more into backend frameworks while making this, so I didn't quite style the _FrontEnd_ effectively. Anyways, there's always a lot to learn.

## Can I use this project for personal cause?

> Live Free or Die.

This epic quote of the Open Source Revolution which I believe quite fiercely, has been my inspiration since months. So, to actually looking forward to contribute to the open source, I have put my project up here at **GitHub** and would be so glad if you clone this project and make this your own. I will describe the process to do that below, as well.

## How to clone and start working on this project?

- First of all get a nice grip on **Git** and **GitHub** using numerous invaluable YouTube tutorials. 
    - [Git and GitHub Crash Course, Traversy Media](https://youtu.be/SWYqp7iY_Tc)
    - [Git Tutorials for Beginners, Telusko](https://youtu.be/WbwIoQYP6no)
    - [What is Git | DevOps Tutorial, Edureka](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuB1Id2Wxak)
- Clone the repo to your local device
- Write the command `npm install` in your terminal after changing to the project directory to install the required dependencies.
- Go through the `app.js` file to learn the backend logic behind the workflow of the website
- You'll see some files with `.ejs` extension which are the *HTML Templates* created using **EJS**.

> It's your wish if to give any credits to the author in the `footer.ejs` section or not. It's not at all a necessary cause.

### Reach Me Out
I love hanging out with other developers, since that is the biggest learning oppurtunity as well as a lot of fun, trust me.
If you're anywhere around my hometown, or I in yours, will definitely want to catch up sometime.
